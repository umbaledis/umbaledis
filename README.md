- 👋 Hi, I’m @umbaledis
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to automate my life tasks that steal valuable time
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I'm going off grid for a while and I would like to purchase a fake I'd or two with a working ss№ would be preferable... 
Maybe some quality fake $ even a skimmer, I'm looking for a skimmer so I can make duplicates of my cards!!nd actually not even really sure how to begin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a robot who will copy and paste my data into gift card balance checker sites say like once a day, from multiple servers and post findings somewhere. 
I tried using GCB, GCBpro but fairly certain they were copy cat apps so I just accept the loss,. So upset!!
But I digress. I will take any help offered and thank you in advance anyone who is interested
- 📫 How to reach me ...my email is umbaledis@gmail.com.  Any other advice I am very receptive to, not even sure how much personal info I should be offering at this point but I don't care 
I'm broke and my identity stolen might get the theif  arrested if they run my name lollloly
